[Chinese Version](/solution/2100-2199/2132.Stamping%20the%20Grid/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>grid</code> where each cell is either <code>0</code> (empty) or <code>1</code> (occupied).</p>

<p>You are then given stamps of size <code>stampHeight x stampWidth</code>. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given <strong>restrictions</strong> and <strong>requirements</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cover all the <strong>empty</strong> cells.</li>
	<li>Do not cover any of the <strong>occupied</strong> cells.</li>
	<li>We can put as <strong>many</strong> stamps as we want.</li>
	<li>Stamps can <strong>overlap</strong> with each other.</li>
	<li>Stamps are not allowed to be <strong>rotated</strong>.</li>
	<li>Stamps must stay completely <strong>inside</strong> the grid.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return <code>true</code> <em>if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return</em> <code>false</code>.</p>

<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.

<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2, stampWidth = 2

<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells without the stamps going outside the grid.

	<li><code>grid[r][c]</code> is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Two-Dimensional Prefix Sum + Two-Dimensional Difference

According to the problem description, every empty cell must be covered by a stamp, and no occupied cell can be covered. Therefore, we can traverse the two-dimensional matrix, and for each cell, if all cells in the area of $stampHeight \times stampWidth$ with this cell as the upper left corner are empty (i.e., not occupied), then we can place a stamp at this cell.

To quickly determine whether all cells in an area are empty, we can use a two-dimensional prefix sum. We use $s_{i,j}$ to represent the number of occupied cells in the sub-matrix from $(1,1)$ to $(i,j)$ in the two-dimensional matrix. That is, $s_{i, j} = s_{i - 1, j} + s_{i, j - 1} - s_{i - 1, j - 1} + grid_{i-1, j-1}$.

Then, with $(i, j)$ as the upper left corner, and the height and width are $stampHeight$ and $stampWidth$ respectively, the lower right coordinate of the sub-matrix is $(x, y) = (i + stampHeight - 1, j + stampWidth - 1)$. We can calculate the number of occupied cells in this sub-matrix through $s_{x, y} - s_{x, j - 1} - s_{i - 1, y} + s_{i - 1, j - 1}$. If the number of occupied cells in this sub-matrix is $0$, then we can place a stamp at $(i, j)$. After placing the stamp, all cells in this $stampHeight \times stampWidth$ area will become occupied cells. We can use a two-dimensional difference array $d$ to record this change. That is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d_{i, j} &\leftarrow d_{i, j} + 1 \\
d_{i, y + 1} &\leftarrow d_{i, y + 1} - 1 \\
d_{x + 1, j} &\leftarrow d_{x + 1, j} - 1 \\
d_{x + 1, y + 1} &\leftarrow d_{x + 1, y + 1} + 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we perform a prefix sum operation on the two-dimensional difference array $d$ to find out the number of times each cell is covered by a stamp. If a cell is not occupied and the number of times it is covered by a stamp is $0$, then we cannot place a stamp at this cell, so we need to return $\texttt{false}$. If all "unoccupied cells" are successfully covered by stamps, return $\texttt{true}$.

The time complexity is $O(m \times n)$, and the space complexity is $O(m \times n)$. Here, $m$ and $n$ are the height and width of the two-dimensional matrix, respectively.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean possibleToStamp(int[][] grid, int stampHeight, int stampWidth) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] s = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                s[i][j] = s[i - 1][j] + s[i][j - 1] - s[i - 1][j - 1] + grid[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
        }
        int[][] d = new int[m + 2][n + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i + stampHeight - 1 <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j + stampWidth - 1 <= n; ++j) {
                int x = i + stampHeight - 1, y = j + stampWidth - 1;
                if (s[x][y] - s[x][j - 1] - s[i - 1][y] + s[i - 1][j - 1] == 0) {
                    d[i][j]++;
                    d[i][y + 1]--;
                    d[x + 1][j]--;
                    d[x + 1][y + 1]++;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                d[i][j] += d[i - 1][j] + d[i][j - 1] - d[i - 1][j - 1];
                if (grid[i - 1][j - 1] == 0 && d[i][j] == 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
