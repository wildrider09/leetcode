# [2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences)

[Chinese Version](/solution/2100-2199/2114.Maximum%20Number%20of%20Words%20Found%20in%20Sentences/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>A <strong>sentence</strong> is a list of <strong>words</strong> that are separated by a single space&nbsp;with no leading or trailing spaces.</p>

<p>You are given an array of strings <code>sentences</code>, where each <code>sentences[i]</code> represents a single <strong>sentence</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum number of words</strong> that appear in a single sentence</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sentences = [&quot;alice and bob love leetcode&quot;, &quot;i think so too&quot;, <u>&quot;this is great thanks very much&quot;</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- The first sentence, &quot;alice and bob love leetcode&quot;, has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, &quot;i think so too&quot;, has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, &quot;this is great thanks very much&quot;, has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sentences = [&quot;please wait&quot;, <u>&quot;continue to fight&quot;</u>, <u>&quot;continue to win&quot;</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sentences.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sentences[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>sentences[i]</code> consists only of lowercase English letters and <code>&#39; &#39;</code> only.</li>
	<li><code>sentences[i]</code> does not have leading or trailing spaces.</li>
	<li>All the words in <code>sentences[i]</code> are separated by a single space.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Space Counting

We iterate through the array `sentences`. For each sentence, we count the number of spaces, then the number of words is the number of spaces plus $1$. Finally, we return the maximum number of words.

The time complexity is $O(L)$, where $L$ is the total length of all strings in the array `sentences`. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (var s : sentences) {
            int cnt = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                    ++cnt;
                }
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, cnt);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
