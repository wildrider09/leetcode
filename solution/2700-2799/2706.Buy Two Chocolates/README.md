# [2706. Buy Two Chocolates](https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates)

[Chinese Version](/solution/2700-2799/2706.Buy%20Two%20Chocolates/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> representing the prices of various chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer <code>money</code>, which represents your initial amount of money.</p>

<p>You must buy <strong>exactly</strong> two chocolates in such a way that you still have some <strong>non-negative</strong> leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.</p>

<p>Return <em>the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates</em>. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return <code>money</code>. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,2], money = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [3,2,3], money = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot buy 2 chocolates without going in debt, so we return 3.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= money &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Sorting

We can sort the prices of the chocolates in ascending order, and then add the first two prices to get the minimum cost $cost$ of buying two chocolates. If this cost is greater than the money we have, then we return `money`. Otherwise, we return `money - cost`.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$. Where $n$ is the length of the array `prices`.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int buyChoco(int[] prices, int money) {
        Arrays.sort(prices);
        int cost = prices[0] + prices[1];
        return money < cost ? money : money - cost;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: One-pass Traversal

We can find the two smallest prices in one pass, and then calculate the cost.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array `prices`. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int buyChoco(int[] prices, int money) {
        int a = 1000, b = 1000;
        for (int x : prices) {
            if (x < a) {
                b = a;
                a = x;
            } else if (x < b) {
                b = x;
            }
        }
        int cost = a + b;
        return money < cost ? money : money - cost;
    }
}
```
