# [3029. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-revert-word-to-initial-state-i)

[Chinese Version](/solution/3000-3099/3029.Minimum%20Time%20to%20Revert%20Word%20to%20Initial%20State%20I/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>word</code> and an integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>At every second, you must perform the following operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remove the first <code>k</code> characters of <code>word</code>.</li>
	<li>Add any <code>k</code> characters to the end of <code>word</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform <strong>both</strong> operations at every second.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> time greater than zero required for</em> <code>word</code> <em>to revert to its <strong>initial</strong> state</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abacaba&quot;, k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At the 1st second, we remove characters &quot;aba&quot; from the prefix of word, and add characters &quot;bac&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;cababac&quot;.
At the 2nd second, we remove characters &quot;cab&quot; from the prefix of word, and add &quot;aba&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;abacaba&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abacaba&quot;, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At the 1st second, we remove characters &quot;abac&quot; from the prefix of word, and add characters &quot;caba&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;abacaba&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 1 second is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abcbabcd&quot;, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At every second, we will remove the first 2 characters of word, and add the same characters to the end of word.
After 4 seconds, word becomes equal to &quot;abcbabcd&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 4 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 50 </code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= word.length</code></li>
	<li><code>word</code> consists only of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Enumeration

Let's assume that if we can restore `word` to its initial state with only one operation, it means that `word[k:]` is a prefix of `word`, i.e., `word[k:] == word[:n-k]`.

If there are multiple operations, let's assume $i$ is the number of operations, then it means that `word[k*i:]` is a prefix of `word`, i.e., `word[k*i:] == word[:n-k*i]`.

Therefore, we can enumerate the number of operations and check whether `word[k*i:]` is a prefix of `word`. If it is, then return $i$.

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of `word`.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTimeToInitialState(String word, int k) {
        int n = word.length();
        for (int i = k; i < n; i += k) {
            if (word.substring(i).equals(word.substring(0, n - i))) {
                return i / k;
            }
        }
        return (n + k - 1) / k;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Enumeration + String Hash

Based on Solution 1, we can also use string hashing to determine whether two strings are equal.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of `word`.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### Java

```java
class Hashing {
    private final long[] p;
    private final long[] h;
    private final long mod;

    public Hashing(String word, long base, int mod) {
        int n = word.length();
        p = new long[n + 1];
        h = new long[n + 1];
        p[0] = 1;
        this.mod = mod;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            p[i] = p[i - 1] * base % mod;
            h[i] = (h[i - 1] * base + word.charAt(i - 1) - 'a') % mod;
        }
    }

    public long query(int l, int r) {
        return (h[r] - h[l - 1] * p[r - l + 1] % mod + mod) % mod;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int minimumTimeToInitialState(String word, int k) {
        Hashing hashing = new Hashing(word, 13331, 998244353);
        int n = word.length();
        for (int i = k; i < n; i += k) {
            if (hashing.query(1, n - i) == hashing.query(i + 1, n)) {
                return i / k;
            }
        }
        return (n + k - 1) / k;
    }
}
```
