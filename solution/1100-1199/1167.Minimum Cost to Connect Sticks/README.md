# [1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks 🔒](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks)

[Chinese Version](/solution/1100-1199/1167.Minimum%20Cost%20to%20Connect%20Sticks/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array&nbsp;<code>sticks</code>, where&nbsp;<code>sticks[i]</code>&nbsp;is the length of the&nbsp;<code>i<sup>th</sup></code>&nbsp;stick.</p>

<p>You can connect any two sticks of lengths <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> into one stick&nbsp;by paying a cost of <code>x + y</code>. You must connect&nbsp;all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.</p>

<p>Return&nbsp;<em>the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sticks = [2,4,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 14
<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;You start with sticks = [2,4,3].
1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sticks = [1,8,3,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 30
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].
1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sticks = [5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is only one stick, so you don&#39;t need to do anything. The total cost is 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code><span>1 &lt;= sticks.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></span></code></li>
	<li><code><span>1 &lt;= sticks[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></span></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Greedy + Priority Queue (Min Heap)

We can use a greedy approach, each time choosing the shortest two sticks to connect, which ensures the minimum cost of connection.

Therefore, we can use a priority queue (min heap) to maintain the current stick lengths. Each time, we take out two sticks from the priority queue to connect, then put the connected stick back into the priority queue, until there is only one stick left in the priority queue.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the array `sticks`.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int x : sticks) {
            pq.offer(x);
        }
        int ans = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int z = pq.poll() + pq.poll();
            ans += z;
            pq.offer(z);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
