# [1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element)

[Chinese Version](/solution/1800-1899/1838.Frequency%20of%20the%20Most%20Frequent%20Element/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>The <strong>frequency</strong> of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.</p>

<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. In one operation, you can choose an index of <code>nums</code> and increment the element at that index by <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum possible frequency</strong> of an element after performing <strong>at most</strong> </em><code>k</code><em> operations</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 3<strong>
Explanation:</strong> Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Sorting + Prefix Sum + Binary Search

According to the problem description, we can draw three conclusions:

1. After several operations, the element with the highest frequency in the array must be an element in the original array. Why? Suppose the elements operated are $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m$, where the maximum is $a_m$. These elements have all been changed to the same value $x$, where $x \geq a_m$. Then we can also change these elements all to $a_m$, and the number of operations will not increase.
2. The elements operated must be a continuous subarray in the sorted array.
3. If a frequency $m$ satisfies the condition, then all $m' < m$ also satisfy the condition. This inspires us to consider using binary search to find the maximum frequency that satisfies the condition.

Therefore, we can sort the array $nums$ and then calculate the prefix sum array $s$ of the sorted array, where $s[i]$ represents the sum of the first $i$ elements.

Next, we define the left boundary of the binary search as $l = 1$, and the right boundary as $r = n$. For each binary search, we take the middle value $m = (l + r + 1) / 2$, and then check whether there exists a continuous subarray of length $m$ such that all elements in the subarray can be changed to an element in the array, and the number of operations does not exceed $k$. If such a subarray exists, we can update the left boundary $l$ to $m$, otherwise update the right boundary $r$ to $m - 1$.

Finally, return the left boundary $l$.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Where $n$ is the length of the array $nums$.

    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        this.k = k;
        this.nums = nums;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        s = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            s[i] = s[i - 1] + nums[i - 1];
        }
        int l = 1, r = n;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r + 1) >> 1;
            if (check(mid)) {
                l = mid;
            } else {
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }

    private boolean check(int m) {
        for (int i = m; i <= nums.length; ++i) {
            if (1L * nums[i - 1] * m - (s[i] - s[i - m]) <= k) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Sorting + Two Pointers

We can also use two pointers to maintain a sliding window, where all elements in the window can be changed to the maximum value in the window. The number of operations for the elements in the window is $s$, and $s \leq k$.

Initially, we set the left pointer $j$ to point to the first element of the array, and the right pointer $i$ also points to the first element of the array. Next, we move the right pointer $i$ each time, changing all elements in the window to $nums[i]$. At this time, the number of operations to be increased is $(nums[i] - nums[i - 1]) \times (i - j)$. If this number of operations exceeds $k$, then we need to move the left pointer $j$ until the number of operations for the elements in the window does not exceed $k$. Then, we update the answer to the maximum length of the window.

The time complexity is $O(n \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$. Where $n$ is the length of the array $nums$.

            while (s > k) {
                s -= nums[i] - nums[j++];
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, i - j + 1);
