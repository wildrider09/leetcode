# [765. Couples Holding Hands](https://leetcode.com/problems/couples-holding-hands)

[Chinese Version](/solution/0700-0799/0765.Couples%20Holding%20Hands/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> couples sitting in <code>2n</code> seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.</p>

<p>The people and seats are represented by an integer array <code>row</code> where <code>row[i]</code> is the ID of the person sitting in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being <code>(0, 1)</code>, the second couple being <code>(2, 3)</code>, and so on with the last couple being <code>(2n - 2, 2n - 1)</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side</em>. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> row = [0,2,1,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> row = [3,2,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> All couples are already seated side by side.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2n == row.length</code></li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 30</code>​​​​​​​</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= row[i] &lt; 2n</code></li>
	<li>All the elements of <code>row</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Union-Find

We can assign a number to each pair of couples. Person with number $0$ and $1$ corresponds to couple $0$, person with number $2$ and $3$ corresponds to couple $1$, and so on. In other words, the person corresponding to $row[i]$ has a couple number of $\lfloor \frac{row[i]}{2} \rfloor$.

If there are $k$ pairs of couples who are seated incorrectly with respect to each other, i.e., if $k$ pairs of couples are in the same permutation cycle, it will take $k-1$ swaps for all of them to be seated correctly.

Why? Consider the following: we first adjust the positions of a couple to their correct seats. After this, the problem reduces from $k$ couples to $k-1$ couples. This process continues, and when $k = 1$, the number of swaps required is $0$. Therefore, if $k$ pairs of couples are in the wrong positions, we need $k-1$ swaps.

Thus, we only need to traverse the array once, use union-find to determine how many permutation cycles there are. Suppose there are $x$ cycles, and the size of each cycle (in terms of couple pairs) is $y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_x$. The number of swaps required is $y_1-1 + y_2-1 + \cdots + y_x-1 = y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_x - x = n - x$.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \alpha(n))$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which can be considered a very small constant.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    private int[] p;

    public int minSwapsCouples(int[] row) {
        int n = row.length >> 1;
        p = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            p[i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n << 1; i += 2) {
            int a = row[i] >> 1, b = row[i + 1] >> 1;
            p[find(a)] = find(b);
        }
        int ans = n;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i == find(i)) {
                --ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int find(int x) {
        if (p[x] != x) {
            p[x] = find(p[x]);
        }
        return p[x];
    }
}
```
