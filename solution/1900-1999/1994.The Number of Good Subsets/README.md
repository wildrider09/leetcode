# [1994. The Number of Good Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets)

[Chinese Version](/solution/1900-1999/1994.The%20Number%20of%20Good%20Subsets/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>. We call a subset of <code>nums</code> <strong>good</strong> if its product can be represented as a product of one or more <strong>distinct prime</strong> numbers.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, if <code>nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>:

    <ul>
    	<li><code>[2, 3]</code>, <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, and <code>[1, 3]</code> are <strong>good</strong> subsets with products <code>6 = 2*3</code>, <code>6 = 2*3</code>, and <code>3 = 3</code> respectively.</li>
    	<li><code>[1, 4]</code> and <code>[4]</code> are not <strong>good</strong> subsets with products <code>4 = 2*2</code> and <code>4 = 2*2</code> respectively.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

<p>Return <em>the number of different <strong>good</strong> subsets in </em><code>nums</code><em> <strong>modulo</strong> </em><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from <code>nums</code>. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The good subsets are:
- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,2,3,15]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The good subsets are:
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 30</code></li>
</ul>

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfGoodSubsets(int[] nums) {
        int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};
        int[] cnt = new int[31];
        for (int x : nums) {
            ++cnt[x];
        }
        final int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        int n = primes.length;
        long[] f = new long[1 << n];
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < cnt[1]; ++i) {
            f[0] = (f[0] * 2) % mod;
        }
        for (int x = 2; x < 31; ++x) {
            if (cnt[x] == 0 || x % 4 == 0 || x % 9 == 0 || x % 25 == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int mask = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (x % primes[i] == 0) {
                    mask |= 1 << i;
                }
            }
            for (int state = (1 << n) - 1; state > 0; --state) {
                if ((state & mask) == mask) {
                    f[state] = (f[state] + cnt[x] * f[state ^ mask]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < 1 << n; ++i) {
            ans = (ans + f[i]) % mod;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
