# [1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game)

[Chinese Version](/solution/1900-1999/1996.The%20Number%20of%20Weak%20Characters%20in%20the%20Game/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has <strong>two</strong> main properties: <strong>attack</strong> and <strong>defense</strong>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>properties</code> where <code>properties[i] = [attack<sub>i</sub>, defense<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the properties of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character in the game.</p>

<p>A character is said to be <strong>weak</strong> if any other character has <strong>both</strong> attack and defense levels <strong>strictly greater</strong> than this character&#39;s attack and defense levels. More formally, a character <code>i</code> is said to be <strong>weak</strong> if there exists another character <code>j</code> where <code>attack<sub>j</sub> &gt; attack<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>defense<sub>j</sub> &gt; defense<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of <strong>weak</strong> characters</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= properties.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>properties[i].length == 2</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= attack<sub>i</sub>, defense<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Sorting + Traversal

We can sort all characters in descending order of attack power and ascending order of defense power.

Then, traverse all characters. For the current character, if its defense power is less than the previous maximum defense power, it is a weak character, and we increment the answer by one. Otherwise, update the maximum defense power.

After the traversal, we get the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of characters.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        Arrays.sort(properties, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0] == 0 ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]);
        int ans = 0, mx = 0;
        for (var x : properties) {
            if (x[1] < mx) {
                ++ans;
            }
            mx = Math.max(mx, x[1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
