# [877. Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game)

[Chinese Version](/solution/0800-0899/0877.Stone%20Game/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an <strong>even</strong> number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a <strong>positive</strong> integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The <strong>total</strong> number of stones across all the piles is <strong>odd</strong>, so there are no ties.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob take turns, with <strong>Alice starting first</strong>. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the <strong>beginning</strong> or from the <strong>end</strong> of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the <strong>most stones wins</strong>.</p>

<p>Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return <code>true</code><em> if Alice wins the game, or </em><code>false</code><em> if Bob wins</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> piles = [5,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> piles = [3,7,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>piles.length</code> is <strong>even</strong>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>sum(piles[i])</code> is <strong>odd</strong>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Memoization Search

We design a function $dfs(i, j)$ that represents the maximum difference in the number of stones between the current player and the other player when considering piles from the $i$-th to the $j$-th. The answer is then $dfs(0, n - 1) \gt 0$.

The function $dfs(i, j)$ is computed as follows:

- If $i \gt j$, there are no stones left, so the current player cannot take any stones and the difference is $0$, i.e., $dfs(i, j) = 0$.
- Otherwise, the current player has two choices: if they take the $i$-th pile, the difference between the current player and the other player is $piles[i] - dfs(i + 1, j)$; if they take the $j$-th pile, the difference is $piles[j] - dfs(i, j - 1)$. The current player will choose the option with the larger difference, so $dfs(i, j) = \max(piles[i] - dfs(i + 1, j), piles[j] - dfs(i, j - 1))$.

Finally, we only need to check whether $dfs(0, n - 1) \gt 0$.

To avoid redundant computation, we can use memoization: we use an array $f$ to record all values of $dfs(i, j)$, so that when the function is called again, we can directly retrieve the answer from $f$ without recomputing.

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and the space complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of stone piles.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    private int[] piles;
    private int[][] f;

    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        this.piles = piles;
        int n = piles.length;
        f = new int[n][n];
        return dfs(0, n - 1) > 0;
    }

    private int dfs(int i, int j) {
        if (i > j) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (f[i][j] != 0) {
            return f[i][j];
        }
        return f[i][j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dfs(i + 1, j), piles[j] - dfs(i, j - 1));
    }
}

### Solution 2: Dynamic Programming

We can also use dynamic programming. Define $f[i][j]$ as the maximum difference in the number of stones the current player can obtain over the other player from piles $piles[i..j]$. The final answer is then $f[0][n - 1] \gt 0$.

Initially, $f[i][i] = piles[i]$, because with only one pile, the current player can only take that pile, and the difference is $piles[i]$.

For $f[i][j]$ where $i \lt j$, there are two cases:

- If the current player takes pile $piles[i]$, the remaining piles are $piles[i + 1..j]$, and it becomes the other player's turn, so $f[i][j] = piles[i] - f[i + 1][j]$.
- If the current player takes pile $piles[j]$, the remaining piles are $piles[i..j - 1]$, and it becomes the other player's turn, so $f[i][j] = piles[j] - f[i][j - 1]$.

Therefore, the final state transition equation is $f[i][j] = \max(piles[i] - f[i + 1][j], piles[j] - f[i][j - 1])$.

Finally, we only need to check whether $f[0][n - 1] \gt 0$.

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and the space complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of stone piles.
