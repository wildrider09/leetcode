## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given a string <code>s</code> that contains digits <code>0-9</code>, addition symbols <code>&#39;+&#39;</code>, and multiplication symbols <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> <strong>only</strong>, representing a <strong>valid</strong> math expression of <strong>single digit numbers</strong> (e.g., <code>3+5*2</code>). This expression was given to <code>n</code> elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this <strong>order of operations</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Compute <strong>multiplication</strong>, reading from <strong>left to right</strong>; Then,</li>
	<li>Compute <strong>addition</strong>, reading from <strong>left to right</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are given an integer array <code>answers</code> of length <code>n</code>, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the <code>answers</code>, by following these <strong>rules</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If an answer <strong>equals</strong> the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded <code>5</code> points;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the answer <strong>could be interpreted</strong> as if the student applied the operators <strong>in the wrong order</strong> but had <strong>correct arithmetic</strong>, this student will be rewarded <code>2</code> points;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, this student will be rewarded <code>0</code> points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the sum of the points of the students</em>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;7+3*1*2&quot;, answers = [20,13,42]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,<u><strong>13</strong></u>,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [<u><strong>20</strong></u>,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;3+5*2&quot;, answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
<strong>Output:</strong> 19
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [<strong><u>13</u></strong>,0,10,<strong><u>13</u></strong>,<strong><u>13</u></strong>,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,<strong><u>16</u></strong>,<strong><u>16</u></strong>]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;6+0*1&quot;, answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.
The points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 31</code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> represents a valid expression that contains only digits <code>0-9</code>, <code>&#39;+&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> only.</li>
	<li>All the integer operands in the expression are in the <strong>inclusive</strong> range <code>[0, 9]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;=</code> The count of all operators (<code>&#39;+&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;*&#39;</code>) in the math expression <code>&lt;= 15</code></li>
	<li>Test data are generated such that the correct answer of the expression is in the range of <code>[0, 1000]</code>.</li>

	<li><code>0 &lt;= answers[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming (Interval DP)

First, we design a function $cal(s)$ to calculate the result of a valid mathematical expression that only contains single-digit numbers. The correct answer is $x = cal(s)$.

Let the length of the string $s$ be $n$, then the number of digits in $s$ is $m = \frac{n+1}{2}$.

We define $f[i][j]$ as the possible values of the result calculated by selecting the digits from the $i$-th to the $j$-th in $s$ (index starts from $0$). Initially, $f[i][i]$ represents the selection of the $i$-th digit, and the result can only be this digit itself, i.e., $f[i][i] = \{s[i \times 2]\}$ (the $i$-th digit maps to the character at index $i \times 2$ in the string $s$).

Next, we enumerate $i$ from large to small, and then enumerate $j$ from small to large. We need to find out the possible values of the results of the operation of all digits in the interval $[i, j]$. We enumerate the boundary point $k$ in the interval $[i, j]$, then $f[i][j]$ can be obtained from $f[i][k]$ and $f[k+1][j]$ through the operator $s[k \times 2 + 1]$. Therefore, we can get the following state transition equation:

$$
f[i][j] = \begin{cases}
\{s[i \times 2]\}, & i = j \\
\bigcup\limits_{k=i}^{j-1} \{f[i][k] \otimes f[k+1][j]\}, & i < j
\end{cases}
$$

Where $\otimes$ represents the operator, i.e., $s[k \times 2 + 1]$.

The possible values of the results of all digit operations in the string $s$ are $f[0][m-1]$.

Finally, we count the answer. We use an array $cnt$ to count the number of times each answer appears in the answer array $answers$. If the answer is equal to $x$, then this student gets $5$ points, otherwise if the answer is in $f[0][m-1]$, then this student gets $2$ points. Traverse $cnt$ to count the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n^3 \times M^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n^2 \times M^2)$. Here, $M$ is the maximum possible value of the answer, and $n$ is the number of digits in the length of the string $s$.
