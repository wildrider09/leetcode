### Solution 1: Mathematics + Two Pointers

We can use the two-pointer method to solve this problem. Define two pointers $a$ and $b$, pointing to $0$ and $\sqrt{c}$ respectively. In each step, we calculate the value of $s = a^2 + b^2$, and then compare the size of $s$ and $c$. If $s = c$, we have found two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = c$. If $s < c$, we increase the value of $a$ by $1$. If $s > c$, we decrease the value of $b$ by $1$. We continue this process until we find the answer, or the value of $a$ is greater than the value of $b$, and return `false`.

The time complexity is $O(\sqrt{c})$, where $c$ is the given non-negative integer. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

        long a = 0, b = (long) Math.sqrt(c);
        while (a <= b) {
            long s = a * a + b * b;
            if (s == c) {
                return true;
            }
            if (s < c) {
                ++a;
            } else {
                --b;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

### Solution 2: Mathematics

This problem is essentially about the conditions under which a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This theorem dates back to Fermat and Euler and is a classic result in number theory.

Specifically, the theorem can be stated as follows:

> A positive integer $n$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if all prime factors of $n$ of the form $4k + 3$ have even powers.

This means that if we decompose $n$ into the product of its prime factors, $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are primes and $e_i$ are their corresponding exponents, then $n$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if all prime factors $p_i$ of the form $4k + 3$ have even exponents $e_i$.

More formally, if $p_i$ is a prime of the form $4k + 3$, then for each such $p_i$, $e_i$ must be even.

For example:

- The number $13$ is a prime and $13 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, so it can be expressed as the sum of two squares, i.e., $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$.
- The number $21$ can be decomposed into $3 \times 7$, where both $3$ and $7$ are prime factors of the form $4k + 3$ and their exponents are $1$ (odd), so $21$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares.

In summary, this theorem is very important in number theory for determining whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares.

The time complexity is $O(\sqrt{c})$, where $c$ is the given non-negative integer. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

                int exp = 0;
                while (c % i == 0) {
                    c /= i;
                    ++exp;
                }
                if (i % 4 == 3 && exp % 2 != 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return c % 4 != 3;
    }
