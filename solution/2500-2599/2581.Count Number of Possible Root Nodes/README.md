# [2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-possible-root-nodes)

[Chinese Version](/solution/2500-2599/2581.Count%20Number%20of%20Possible%20Root%20Nodes/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Alice has an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.</p>

<p>Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several <strong>guesses</strong> about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chooses two <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> such that there exists an edge <code>[u, v]</code> in the tree.</li>
	<li>He tells Alice that <code>u</code> is the <strong>parent</strong> of <code>v</code> in the tree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob&#39;s guesses are represented by a 2D integer array <code>guesses</code> where <code>guesses[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates Bob guessed <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> to be the parent of <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>.</p>

<p>Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob&#39;s guesses, but just says that <strong>at least</strong> <code>k</code> of his guesses are <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Given the 2D integer arrays <code>edges</code>, <code>guesses</code> and the integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the <strong>number of possible nodes</strong> that can be the root of Alice&#39;s tree</em>. If there is no such tree, return <code>0</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.

<strong>Input:</strong> edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1

Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]

Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Tree DP (change root)

First, we traverse the given edge set $edges$ and convert it to an adjacency list $g$ where $g[i]$ represents the adjacent nodes of node $i$. Use a hash map $gs$ to record the given guess set $guesses$.

Then, we start from node $0$ and perform a DFS to count the number of edges in $guesses$ among all the nodes that can be reached from node $0$. We use the variable $cnt$ to record this number.

Next, we start from node $0$ and perform a DFS to count the number of edges in $guesses$ in each tree with $0$ as the root. If the number is greater than or equal to $k$, it means that this node is a possible root node, and we add $1$ to the answer.

Therefore, the problem becomes to count the number of edges in $guesses$ in each tree with each node as the root. We already know that there are $cnt$ edges in $guesses$ among all the nodes that can be reached from node $0$. We can maintain this value by adding or subtracting the current edge in $guesses$ in DFS.

Assume that we are currently traversing node $i$ and $cnt$ represents the number of edges in $guesses$ with $i$ as the root node. Then, for each adjacent node $j$ of $i$, we need to calculate the number of edges in $guesses$ with $j$ as the root node. If $(i, j)$ is in $guesses$, then there is no edge $(i, j)$ in the tree with $j$ as the root node, so $cnt$ should decrease by $1$. If $(j, i)$ is in $guesses$, then there is an extra edge $(i, j)$ in the tree with $j$ as the root node, so $cnt$ should increase by $1$. That is, $f[j] = f[i] + (j, i) \in guesses - (i, j) \in guesses$. Where $f[i]$ represents the number of edges in $guesses$ with $i$ as the root node.

The time complexity is $O(n + m)$ and the space complexity is $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of $edges$ and $guesses$ respectively.
