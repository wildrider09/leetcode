# [2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags)

[Chinese Version](/solution/2500-2599/2551.Put%20Marbles%20in%20Bags/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You have <code>k</code> bags. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>weights</code> where <code>weights[i]</code> is the weight of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> marble. You are also given the integer <code>k.</code></p>

<p>Divide the marbles into the <code>k</code> bags according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No bag is empty.</li>
	<li>If the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> marble and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> indices should also be in that same bag.</li>
	<li>If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> inclusively, then the cost of the bag is <code>weights[i] + weights[j]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>score</strong> after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the <code>k</code> bags.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>difference</strong> between the <strong>maximum</strong> and <strong>minimum</strong> scores among marble distributions</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1, 3], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= weights.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Problem Transformation + Sorting

We can transform the problem into: dividing the array `weights` into $k$ consecutive subarrays, that is, we need to find $k-1$ splitting points, each splitting point's cost is the sum of the elements on the left and right of the splitting point. The difference between the sum of the costs of the largest $k-1$ splitting points and the smallest $k-1$ splitting points is the answer.

Therefore, we can process the array `weights` and transform it into an array `arr` of length $n-1$, where `arr[i] = weights[i] + weights[i+1]`. Then we sort the array `arr`, and finally calculate the difference between the sum of the costs of the largest $k-1$ splitting points and the smallest $k-1$ splitting points.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Where $n$ is the length of the array `weights`.

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public long putMarbles(int[] weights, int k) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            arr[i] = weights[i] + weights[i + 1];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i) {
            ans -= arr[i];
            ans += arr[n - 2 - i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
